= Maya Language 1.0


Maya is the simple functional programming language named after my sweetheart wife, Maya.


== Usage

First, you will need to compile the code. Open Language.sln using MonoDevelop 2.2 and build the project. This will create the executable file "Maya.exe" in "Language/bin/Debug" directory. To use the language, either put the Debug directory in your PATH or from Debug directory, execute following command:

./Maya.exe <name_of_code_file>

== Syntax

The language is for learning purpose only and thus, does not have lot of features. In this section, we will look at syntax of functions supported by language till now.

1. Print: To print an output on console, use "print" function. Example:
print "Hello World!"; 	=> Hello World
print 12;		=> 12
number = 1004;		
print number;		=> 1004

2. Assignment: We can assign values to variables using '=' operator as shown above.

3. Addition/Subtraction/Multiplication/Devision: This operations can be done using '+', '-', '*', '/' operators respectively. Example:
print 2+2;		=> 4
print 2*2;		=> 4
print 2/2;		=> 1
print 2-2;		=> 0

4. Functions: Function are defined as follows:

hello = function()
		"Hello";
	end

print hello();		=> Hello

add = 	function(number1, number2)
		number1+number2;
	end

print add(10,2);	=> 12

5. Recursion: Recursion is supported. Example:
repeatHello = function(times)
			if (times-1)
				repeatHello(times-1);
			end
			print "Hello";
		end

repeatHello(5);
=>	Hello
	Hello
	Hello
	Hello
	Hello

This example also shows the use of if statement.

6. Passing functions as function parameter: You can pass functions to other function as parameter. Example:
repeat	= 	function(times, action)
			if (times-1)
				repeat(times-1,action);
			end
			action();
		end

hi	=	function()
			print "Hi";
		end

repeat(2,hi);
=>	Hi
	Hi

== What's Next?

I will be adding few more features to it whenever I get some time.
